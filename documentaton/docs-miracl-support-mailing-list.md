Almost all of the more formalized development and team coordination about the shape and direction of MIRACL takes place on the MIRACL mailing lists. All lists have archives so that you can easily read up on old discussions. These are available from the each list's individual information page that is linked below.

You can read an [introduction to mailing lists](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-member/node5.html) if you have little experience with such.

When posting to the mailing lists, please observe the [mailing list etiquette](http://certivox.org/display/WLCM/Etiquette).

We have set up two mailing lists for supporting MIRACL users and developers. Sign up by clicking on the links below.
